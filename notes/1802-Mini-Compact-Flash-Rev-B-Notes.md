# 1802/Mini Compact Flash Rev B Notes

The Rev B design in this folder is an interim release to corrects the compact flash socket footprint error in the Rev A board. It also incorporates a small improvement in the DMA latency by removing one gate delay, reducing latency by about 100ns. It is possible to field update the Rev A circuit to the Rev B circuit with two cut traces and two patch wires.

There is still an eventual plan for a Rev C design (referred to as "Rev B" in the Rev A notes) that will make some larger design changes but the timeline for that is unknown at this time since the Rev B works well enough and there are other priorities.
